Create a folder were you will put the ff.py and mytext.txt which is a blank txt file (you create it) an a empty folder which is called 'VideoClips' 
where you will put your videos which you want to edit. Create another empty folder 'cutVids' and find some music which you want to overlay
the videos and call it 'moth.mp3'.
